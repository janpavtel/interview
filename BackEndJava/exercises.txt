1. Install cassandra locally.
2. Create simple REST API java maven app using spring boot 
3. App should provide two endpoints:
- POST /api/message 
- POST /api/send
4. App usage examples

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/message -d '{"email":"jan.kowalski@example.com","title":"Interview","content":"simple text","magic_number":101}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/message -d '{"email":"jan.kowalski@example.com","title":"Interview 2","content":"simple text 2","magic_number":22}'

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/message -d '{"email":"anna.zajkowska@example.com","title":"Interview 3","content":"simple text 3","magic_number":101}'

The App should store all 3 messages into cassandra.

curl -X POST localhost:8080/api/send -d '{"magic_number":101}'

The App should send all messages with given magic_number and delete them from database.
 
In our example there will be two email messages:
one to jan.kowalski@example.com with title "Interview", email text "simple text"
second to "anna.zajkowska@example.com" with title "Interview 3", email text "simple text 3"

5. The App should delete automatically messages older than 5 min from DB

6. Install docker locally

7. Create Dockerfile for this App

8. Build Docker image with App.jar (when we run docker image, docker should start The App)

9. Create account on Docker Hub

10. Create private repository on Docker Hub 

11. Push docker image with App.jar into private repository on Docker Hub

12. Pull docker image from private repository from Dockery Hub and Run It (check that everything is working as expected)
