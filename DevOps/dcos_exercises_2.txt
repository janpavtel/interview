DevOps – exercises part 2


1. Create account on Docker Hub.
2. Create public repository hello_yourname in github
3. Install docker on your laptop
4. Create “http hello YourName” docker image. (see: http://nmajor.com/your-first-docker-image/  replace “Hello World!” with “Hello YourName!” )
5. Push configuration for docker image into hello_yourname repository on github
6. Create public repository “simple” on Docker Hub and connect it with hello_yourname repository. Next build image using Docker Hub platform.
7. Pull docker image from Docker Hub platform into your laptop and check that it is working
8. Create trial account on azure ( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ ). It’s required credit card information, but you will receive $200 of Azure credits.
9a. Using https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine generate DC/OS (the newest version 1.8...) template (one public group (1 instance); and 3 private groups:apriv, bpriv, cpriv (1 instance each); one master group (1 instance))
- virtual machine size: D2_V2
9b. Deploy using Azure CLI generated template into Azure
10. Connect to the DC/OS UI from your laptop. 
11. Launch “simple” image from your docker hub public repository on DC/OS using Marathon (examples: https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker.html )
12. Allow to connect  from the Internet to your simple application in DC/OS. 
 - It should be possible to type in browser url similar to http://yourPrefixagents.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com and get “Hello YourName” in response 
 - this is tricky one. You should configure container service from 9. For example you need to configure Inbound security roles in Network Security Group for dc/os agents
13.  Create private repository “advanced” on Docker hub and push image “http hello YourName” into  it from your laptop.
14.  Launch “advanced” image from your docker hub private repository on DC/OS using Marathon (this time use app configuration in marathon: "portMappings": [ { "hostPort": 0, .… )
in order to run images from private repository you will need to provide credentials for marathon 
15. Launch marathon-load-balancer in DC/OS.
16. Allow to connect from the Internet to your advanced application in DC/OS via marathon-load-balancer
17. Launch cassandra (1 node)  on private group apriv and make sure "advanced" app is running on bpriv, and cpriv is free
